# Evolutionary Strategies (ES) Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Evolutionary Strategies (ES) algorithm for solving optimization problems. The ES algorithm is a type of evolutionary computation inspired by natural selection and evolution.

## Overview

The `evolutionary_strategies.py` file contains a simple implementation of the ES algorithm for optimizing a user-defined objective function. The algorithm iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations, using mutation and selection to improve the solutions' fitness.

## Getting Started

To use the ES algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `evolutionary_strategies.py` file and define your objective function under the `objective_function` method.
4. Customize the algorithm parameters such as the number of generations, population size, number of parameters, and mutation scale based on your optimization problem.
5. Run the `evolutionary_strategies.py` file to execute the ES algorithm and obtain the best solution found.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the ES algorithm:

```python
best_solution = evolutionary_strategies(objective_function, num_generations=100, population_size=50, num_parameters=5, mutation_scale=0.1)
print("Best solution found:", best_solution)
print("Objective function value:", objective_function(best_solution))
